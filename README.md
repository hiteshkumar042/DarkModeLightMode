## Project Description: "Dark Mode/Light Mopde Webpage"

This project is a single webpage that allows users to toggle between dark mode and light mode. The webpage was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

The webpage's default mode is light mode, with a white background and black text. However, users can switch to dark mode by clicking on a toggle button. In dark mode, the background changes to black, and the text changes to white, making it easier on the eyes and more visually appealing.

The toggle button is created using HTML and CSS and is designed to switch between the two modes when clicked. JavaScript is used to add functionality to the toggle button, allowing it to switch between light and dark mode when clicked. The jQuery library is also used to simplify the process of toggling between the two modes.
